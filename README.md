# Vectoria
A Word Vector Encoder, used to turn word strings into dense numerical encodings for
machine learning models.

## [FastText](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText)
FastText is a unique word encoding model that combines full words and
character ngrams, allowing encodings of unknown words to be estimated by their
constituent characters.

And, there are [pretrained vectors](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText/blob/master/pretrained-vectors.md) 
available for many languages, which means you can get started quickly. This library
will download and unpack those pretrained models for you.


Take a look at the ```examples``` folder.
